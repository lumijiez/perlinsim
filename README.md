# Terrain Generation and Biome Simulation

This project is a terrain generation and biome simulation system implemented in [programming language]. It uses Perlin noise to generate realistic terrains and simulates various biomes with different features. Below, you will find an overview of the key features and instructions on how to use the project.

## Key Features

### 1. Realistic Terrain Generation Using Perlin Noise

The project employs Perlin noise to generate realistic terrain, creating a varied landscape.

### 2. Random Tree Generation and Distribution

Random trees are generated and distributed across the terrain, with different colors for different tree types.

### 3. Random Flower Generation on Grass Biomes

Grass biomes contain randomly generated flowers to enhance the visual appeal.

### 4. Snowy Mountain Biomes on High Cliffs

High cliffs are transformed into snowy mountain biomes, adding diversity to the terrain.

### 5. Special Pine Trees in Mountain Biomes

Mountain biomes feature a special variant of pine trees to match the snowy environment.

### 6. Position Checks for Trees and Flowers

Trees and flowers are placed intelligently to ensure they do not appear on water or sand.

### 7. Realistic Bird Movement

Birds move in different directions using sine and cosine functions, adding life to the simulation.

### 8. Flat Water

Water is always flat, maintaining a consistent level throughout the terrain.

### 9. Camera Implementation

The project includes a camera system that allows you to control the view using the mouse for targeting and WASD keys for movement.

### 10. Real-Time Noise Intensity Adjustment

You can adjust the noise intensity in real-time using the UP and DOWN keys, allowing you to fine-tune the terrain.
